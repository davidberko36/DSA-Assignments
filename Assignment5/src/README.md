# Description of task.

# Algorithm Implementation Console Application

This Java console application provides implementations of various algorithms and allows users to interact with them through a simple menu-based interface.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Quick Sort
2. Traveling Salesman Problem
3. Huffman Coding
4. Kruskal's Algorithm
5. Dijkstra's Algorithm
6. Quick Hull
7. Strassen Algorithm
8. Prim's Algorithm
9. Merge Sort
10. Closest Pair

## Usage

1. Compile and run the `ConsoleApp.java` file.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to select an algorithm to execute.
3. For Quick Sort, you'll be prompted to enter the array elements.
4. For other algorithms, their respective `main()` methods will be called.

## Input Validation

The application includes input validation to ensure that user inputs are within acceptable ranges.

## Exiting the Application

Choose option 0 from the main menu to exit the application.
